# A decade of office notebook processors

This post is the summary of me researching whether it is worth replacing my [Lenovo Thinkpad T470](https://www.notebookcheck.net/Lenovo-ThinkPad-T470-Core-i5-Full-HD-Notebook-Review.198130.0.html) notebook, a 2017 model, bought 2nd hand in 2020. While the conclusion is that I will wait a bit, this was a nice data research about the evolution of the **computing power of office notebooks over the last decade**.

Hopefully it can help people...

TODO add link to the table.

In this post I focus on key results while the full dataset and associated Python code is available in the Github repository https://github.com/pierre-haessig/notebook-cpu-performance/.

### Dataset description

**About the score**: I've extracted computing performance scores from the [Geekbench 6](https://www.geekbench.com/) data brower https://browser.geekbench.com/ which conveniently make their database public *(in exchange of Geekbench users automatically contributing to the database for free)*. This test provides both a **Single-Core** and **Multi-Core** score. The former is useful to assess the  execution speed of one application (webmail, text editor, spreadsheet...), while the latter is geared towards multi-tasking (or some computations which can exploit all processor cores like video encoding, I believe). Geekbench explains that these scores are **proportional to the processing speed**, so a score which is twice as large means a processor that is twice as fast, that is a computing task completed in half the time, if I got it right.

**About the processors selections**: I've extracted the scores for CPUs found in **typical refurbished office notebooks**, that is **midrange** & **low power** CPUs, aka *Intel Core i5* processors, from the so-called [U series](https://www.makeuseof.com/intel-u-vs-p-vs-h-laptop-cpus/), but also corresponding *AMD Ryzen 5*. The earliest model is the Intel Core i5-5200U launched in 2015, while the most recent is the Intel Core Ultra 125U/135U from late 2023 (there wasn't enough data for the Intel Core Ultra 2xx models of 2024). Notice that there are no refurbished notebooks of 2023 yet on the market, so there is some amount of guessing on what will be the "typical office notebook CPUs" of 2023-2025.

### CPU performance charts

Enough speaking, here are two graphs of processors performance.

#### Rank CPU performance

First a dot plot/boxplot chart showing  CPU performance, ranked by Single-Core performance (which is *close, but not quite*, the same as Multi-Core rank):

![CPUs_GB6_logstats_short_sort-Single_q50](Geekbench 6 plots/CPUs_GB6_logstats_short_sort-Single_q50.png)

The horizontal scale for the score is logarithm, so that each vertical grid line means a difference by a factor 2. This allows superimposing Single-Core (blue) and Multi-Core (green) data.

The diamonds are the Median scores, while the lines show the variability. Indeed, there is not unique value for each CPU, due to the many factors which can affect computing performance: temperature, power source (battery vs AC adapter) and energy saving policy (max performance vs max battery life). To account for this, I've collected about **1000 samples** for each CPU on which I've computed quantiles. The thick lines show the quantiles 25%‚Äì75% (also called interquartile range, which contains half the samples) while the thin line ended by mustaches show the quantiles 10%‚Äì90% (the most extreme deciles which contain 80% of the samples).

Notice that to avoid data overcrowding, this the ‚Äúshort‚Äù version of the chart where I picked one CPU model per generation, while there are typically two (like i5-1135 and i5-1145, with very close performance). The full (twice as long) variant can be find in the [chart repository](https://github.com/pierre-haessig/notebook-cpu-performance/tree/main/Geekbench%206%20plots), along with the sorted by Multi-Score variant.

#### CPU peformance over time, with trend

The  second chart shows performance **evolution over time**. Only median score is shown here, to avoid overcrowding the graph, but with all the CPU models of the dataset. This graph is **interactive** (perhaps a mouse is required, though): hovering each point reveals the processor name and details (number of cores).

![CPUs_bydate_linear_withreg](Geekbench 6 plots/CPUs_bydate_linear_withreg.png)

The dot color and shape discriminate the CPU designer: Intel vs AMD (the  classical term ‚Äúmanufacturer‚Äù is not appropriate for AMD, neither for the latest Intel products). The gray dotted line shows the exponential trend, that is a constant-rate growth rate, in the spirit of Moore‚Äôs law (doubling every 2 years), albeit with a *much smaller rate*, see comments below.

This second plot was done with [Vega-Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/) which is very nice for data exploration and interactivity. However, it is perhaps a bit less customizable than my ‚Äúold & reliable‚Äù plotting companion, [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org) [link...], used for the first chart. In particular, I didn't manage to replicate to the nice log2 scale which I created by manually fiddling with the ticks position and label (see [Retrieve_geekbench.ipynb](https://github.com/pierre-haessig/notebook-cpu-performance/blob/main/Retrieve_geekbench.ipynb) notebook, ‚ÄúLog2 scale variant‚Äù), but could be achieved more cleanly with Matplotlib‚Äôs [tick formatter](https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/ticks/tick-formatters.html). So here is the log2 variant of the performance over time chart, albeit with the raw log2 scores, where the exponential becomes a straight line

![CPUs_bydate_log_withreg](Geekbench 6 plots/CPUs_bydate_log_withreg.png)

The raw log2 score values of [0, 1, 2, 3] corresponds to [1000, 2000, 4000, 8000] (general formula: <span style='font-family:serif;'><i>y</i> = 1000 √ó 2<sup><i>x</i></sup></span>)). Also, because there are also grid lines for half scores (0.5‚Üí1000√ó‚àö2 ‚âà 1414), scores which are different by factor 2 are here separated by two grid lines instead of just one in the first plot.

### Comments of CPU performance

#### 1\)¬†General trend

Sure, there has been *some* progress in CPU performance over the decade üòå

- *but* the progress is faster for Multi-Core than Single-Core performance. In details,  the exponential trend curve fitting yields: 
- **Single-core** trend: +12% per year (¬±1%), or, said differently, a time to double the performance of about 6.25 years (¬±10 months)
- **Multi-core** trend: +20%/y ¬±2%/y, or a time to double the preformance of about T=3.75 years (¬±4 months)
- see [CPUs_plot.ipynb](https://github.com/pierre-haessig/notebook-cpu-performance/blob/main/CPUs_plot.ipynb) notebook for details
- ‚Üí in all case, the growth well slower than the 2 years (that is +41%/y) of the [Moore‚Äôs law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore's_law)

#### 2\)¬†Effect of increased core count

There is clear effect of diminishing returns

- from about 2010 until 2017 (Intel 7th gen, with the Core i5-7*00U), notebook CPUs shipped with 2 cores, with a Multi-Core score close to twice the Single-Core one (2000 vs 1000 for Intel Core i5-7300U)
- from 2018 to 2021, notebook CPUs embed 4 cores, but with Multi-Core to Single-Core scores ratio between 2.5 and 3.0 (at least for median score)
- fast forward to 2024, the most recent CPUS come with 6 (AMD) or even 10‚Äì12 cores (Intel, albeit with only 2 P[owerful?] cores), and the Multi-Core score gets close to 4 times the Single-Core one (8000 vs 2000 for Core Ultra 125U).

#### 3\)¬†Off the trend

The exponential fits gives a false sense of a smooth progress while the true evolution is a bit more stepwise, with some processors ‚Äúlagging behind‚Äù and others ‚Äúahead of their time‚Äù:

- AMD CPUs before 2020 (Ryzen 7 PRO 2700U and Ryzen 5 PRO 3500U) are lagging behind their Intel counterpart, especially for Single-Core performance. Successors have closed the gap, (especially with  Ryzen 5 PRO 5650U)
- From 2018 to 2020, Intel has kept releasing ‚Äúre-refreshed‚Äù versions of 2017 Kaby Lake (7th gen) architecture, so that the difference between the Intel Core i5-8250U (mid 2017), i5-8265U (mid 2018) and i5-10310U (early 2020) is pretty thin
- Performance of Intel processors make some nice leaps with the 11th and 12th gen (Core i5 11\*5G7 and 12\*5U), but things get more mixed starting 2023 with the new branding of ‚ÄúCore Ultra‚Äù processors, which comes with more variants (V and U series in the 2nd gen)

#### 4\)¬†About performance variability

SC vs MC

left ot be explored: effect of chassis.
